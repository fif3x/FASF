# How To Use

1. Start by including the .hpp file in your project (Note: The .hpp file MUST be in the same folder). You can achieve this by writing "#include "FASF.hpp""

2. Select the type of vector you want to scan, either if its a char, int or string

3. Use the function. To do this, write "FASF::vector::scan<type>(vector, elementSearchingFor);"

4. Enjoy :)
